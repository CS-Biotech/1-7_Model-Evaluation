    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our motivation -- we set out to find out how well a machine learning model could be used to predict which cancer cells are benign or malignant, as a form of early diagnosis to improve patient care. What did we learn? Based on our evaluation, the logistic regression model we trained on this dataset shows potential to be useful as a tool to aid physicians in their diagnosis; an F1-score of 0.82 is generally considered good. However, more information from stakeholders might be needed to quantify exactly how \"good\" the model has to be for it to be feasible in a medical setting. Realizing that these decisions might require expert opinions and interdisciplinary collaboration, you call for a meeting with machine learning researchers, biologists, physicians, and your colleagues at the Canadian Cancer Society. You organize your results and learnings into a report, and head off to the meeting with valuable information that could leave a lasting impact on healthcare.\n",
