    "This concludes the practice exercises using the heart failure dataset. Congratulations! From the additional exercises in weeks 6 and 7, you have implemented a machine learning pipeline yourself to train and evaluate a heart failure death prediction model. You have learned how to use the sci-kit learn library to implement this pipeline, seen some common pitfalls along the way, and learned how to interpret the results.\n",

You will discover much more as you continue your learning journey, including different models, training techniques, evaluation methods, data cleaning techniques, and more. You will see a brief review of different models next week to hopefully spark your interest in this vast and ever-growing field."
